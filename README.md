# Roblox Café Simulator ☕  

A fun and interactive Roblox game where players can work together in a virtual café to make drinks for customers using realistic machines and ingredients.  

---

## 🎮 About the Game  
In this game, players take on the role of baristas in a café. They can:
- Use interactive drink machines (milk, chocolate, strawberry, etc.)  
- Combine ingredients to make drinks for other players  
- Explore a custom-built café environment with animations and background music  

I created this project to explore **Roblox Studio**, **Lua scripting**, and **game design** — combining creative building with hands-on scripting to bring interactive systems to life.

## 🧱 Features
- **Custom-built café** interior and layout  
- **Functional drink machines** with scripted touch events  
  - Example: when an empty cup touches a chocolate machine, it fills with chocolate and updates its name  
- **Interactive gameplay** that responds to player actions  
- **Ambient background music** for immersion  
- **Smooth animations** for realistic movement and interaction

## 🧩 Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Roblox Studio** (building + scripting)  
- **Lua** for scripting game logic  
- **ServerScriptService**: main scripts for interactions and animations
- **Workspace**: contains 3D models, parts, interactive objects, and scripts for machine functionality

---

## 🧠 What I Learned  
- Writing **Lua scripts** to handle game logic and touch events  
- Managing **object interactions** in 3D space  
- Organizing Roblox services (Workspace, ServerScriptService, etc.)  
- Combining design and code to make engaging user experiences
